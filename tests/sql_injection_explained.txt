SQL Injection Explained: The ' OR '1'='1 Attack
SQL injection query ' OR '1'='1 is one of the most classic database attack techniques in cybersecurity. Let me explain exactly how it works and why it can be so dangerous.
How SQL Queries Are Normally Structured
When an application searches a database, it typically constructs a SQL query like this:
sqlCopySELECT * FROM shows WHERE name LIKE '%Breaking Bad%'
This query looks for TV shows with "Breaking Bad" in their name. The % symbols are wildcards that match any characters before or after the search term.
What Happens During The Injection
When we send the payload ' OR '1'='1, here's what happens in a vulnerable system:

The application takes our input and directly inserts it into the query:

sqlCopySELECT * FROM shows WHERE name LIKE '%' OR '1'='1%'
